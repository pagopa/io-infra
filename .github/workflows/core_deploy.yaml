name: PR - Core TF Apply

# This pipeline starts automatically when a PR is merged into 'main'.
#
# It is responsible for managing changes related solely to the NEW infrastructure, 
# ensuring that changes have occurred exclusively within the directories listed in "paths."
#
## NOTE: 'NEW infrastructure' refers to the new Terraform infrastructure located in the src/core/prod folder, which no longer requires the terraform.sh script to be applied.
#
# This pipeline first executes a plan and then an apply, which must be approved by the team.
