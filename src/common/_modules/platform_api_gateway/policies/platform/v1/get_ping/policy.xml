<!--
    API Management Policy Description

    This policy implements caching for the API with the following behavior:
    - Inbound: Checks the internal cache for a matching response before forwarding the request
    - Backend: Standard processing, no modifications
    - Outbound: Stores API responses in the cache for 60 seconds
    - Error: Standard error handling

    The cache is configured as "internal" type with no downstream caching.
    Response caching helps reduce backend load and improve response times for frequently accessed endpoints.
